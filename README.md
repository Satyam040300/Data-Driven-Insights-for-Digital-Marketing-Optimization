# Data-Driven Insights for Digital Marketing Optimization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a **digital marketing campaign dataset** to optimize lead conversion, identify funnel bottlenecks, and predict customer lifetime value (CLV). By leveraging **machine learning models**, A/B testing, and funnel analysis, this project provides actionable insights for data-driven marketing decisions.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Lead Conversion Prediction:** Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict conversion likelihood based on campaign attributes.
- **A/B Testing Simulation:** Simulated **two funnel variations (A & B)** and used statistical analysis to measure performance differences.
- **Funnel Bottleneck Analysis:** Simulated a **5-stage funnel**, visualized drop-off rates, and calculated the overall conversion rate.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction:** Built a **Linear Regression model** to predict CLV and identify high-value leads.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identified key features influencing lead conversion using feature importance from the Random Forest model.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
- **Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest Classifier, Linear Regression
- **Statistical Analysis:** A/B Testing with **t-tests**
- **Data Visualization:** Seaborn & Matplotlib for heatmaps, bar plots, and scatter plots

## Results & Insights
Lead Conversion Model: Achieved accurate classification of potential conversions.

A/B Testing: Funnel B showed a higher conversion rate, validated by a statistical test.

Bottleneck Analysis: Identified major drop-offs in specific funnel stages.

CLV Prediction: Determined high-value customers for optimized marketing spend.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

Implement hyperparameter tuning for model performance improvement.

Explore alternative CLV models (e.g., Gamma-Gamma Model, RFM Segmentation).

Integrate real-world marketing campaign data for further validation.
